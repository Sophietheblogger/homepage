# homepage
I'm trying to give my homepage a new look, I used some of the the blocks in the library. I'm using elementor basic. However, once i update, it looks completly different. the colors and are not the same as the preview. Images are missing as well as the spaces between images. I have updated my files and data several times and just not working.?????
